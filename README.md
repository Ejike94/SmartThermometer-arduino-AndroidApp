# SmartThermometer-arduino-AndroidApp
This was my final project at my University. This is an IoT that connects a mobile app to an arduino to retrieve information regarding the temperature of the room.  My Goal in this project was to prove that Bluetooth LE has vulnerability and to introduce a possible to solution to mitigate the problem without exhausting all the resources of the device.
